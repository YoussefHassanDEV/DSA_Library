# DSA_Library

A modern C++ library that implements fundamental data structures (like vectors, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs) and essential algorithms (such as sorting, searching, graph traversal, and dynamic programming).

Perfect for practice, interviews, and learning core computer science concepts.

## ✅ Key Data Structures Implemented

1. **Vector** – Dynamic array with random access and automatic resizing.  
2. **Linked Lists** – Singly and doubly linked lists with full pointer-level control.  
3. **Stack** – LIFO structure supporting push, pop, and top operations.  
4. **Queue** – FIFO implementation including circular queues and deques.  
5. **Binary Tree** – Generic tree node structure with traversal methods.  
6. **Binary Search Tree (BST)** – Sorted tree supporting insert, delete, and search.  
7. **Heap** – Min-heap and max-heap variants with priority queue behavior.  
8. **Trie** – Prefix tree optimized for string and dictionary operations.  
9. **AVL Tree** – Self-balancing BST for guaranteed logarithmic operations.  
10. **Hash Table** – Key-value store with chaining or open addressing.

## ⚙️ Algorithms Included

1. **Sorting Algorithms** – Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort, etc.  
2. **Binary Search** – Recursive and iterative implementations with edge case handling.  
3. **Graph Algorithms** – BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Kruskal, and more.  
4. **Dynamic Programming** – Classic problems like Knapsack, LCS, and Matrix DP.  
5. **Backtracking** – N-Queens, Sudoku solver, Subset generation, etc.  
6. **Divide and Conquer** – Efficient patterns like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
